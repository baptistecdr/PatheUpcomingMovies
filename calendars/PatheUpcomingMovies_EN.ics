DESCRIPTION:Paris\, 1887. Duels have been officially outlawed but are still regular practice. For many\, they are the only way to defend their honor. Fencing master Clément Lacaze tries in vain to prevent his nephew from engaging in an uneven duel with the more experienced Colonel Berchère. Marie-Rose Astié de Valsayre\, a feminist fighting for women's equality\, tries to show that honor is not just a male affair. Actor and director Vincent Perez's historical film makes excellent use of various forms of duels - with épées\, pistols\, and sabres on horseback.

Ihr zehnjähriger Sohn Jason ist Autist\; sein Alltag besteht aus täglichen Routinen und festen Regeln. Als der Familie für Jason eine Förderschule nahegelegt wird\, ist auch Mirco als Vater gefordert. Beide schliessen einen Pakt: Jason verspricht\, sich in der Schule nicht mehr provozieren zu lassen\, wenn Mirco ihm hilft\, einen Lieblingsfussballverein zu finden. Allerdings will Jason sich erst für einen Verein entscheiden\, nachdem er alle 56 Mannschaften der ersten\, zweiten und dritten Liga live in ihren jeweiligen Stadien gesehen hat. Dabei hat er sehr individuelle Kriterien – von Maskottchen und Nachhaltigkeit über Rituale der Spieler bis hin zu den Farben der Fussballschuhe. Auf ihrer aussergewöhnlichen Reise durch Deutschland lassen Vater und Sohn die heimische Routine hinter sich und finden alles\, was sie nie gesucht\, aber definitiv gebraucht haben. Diese feinsinnige Drama-Komödie verbindet die Themen Autismus und Fussballkult mit stärksten Emotionen in alle Richtungen. Authentisch\, liebevoll\, mit viel Esprit und mit einer grossen Portion Humor erzählt der Film\, wie Vater und Sohn aus dem Alltag ausbrechen und sich auf die Reise ihres Lebens begeben. WOCHENENDREBELLEN basiert auf der wahren Geschichte von Mirco und Jason von Juterczenka\, die sie in ihrem Buch „Wir Wochenendrebellen“ veröffentlicht haben.

DESCRIPTION:Nobody likes teacher Paul Hunham (Giamatti) -- not his students\, not his fellow faculty\, not the headmaster\, who all find his pomposity and rigidity exasperating. With no family and nowhere to go over Christmas holiday in 1970\, Paul remains at school to supervise students unable to journey home. After a few days\, only one student holdover remains -- a trouble-making 15-year-old named Angus\, a good student whose bad behavior always threatens to get him expelled. Joining Paul and Angus is head cook Mary (Randolph)-an African American woman who caters to sons of privilege and whose own son was recently lost in Vietnam. These three very different shipwrecked people form an unlikely Christmas family sharing comic misadventures during two very snowy weeks in New England. The real journey is how they help one another understand that they are not beholden to their past-they can choose their own futures.

DESCRIPTION:A night to remember. Maria Callas\, the quintessential diva and the face of the opera in the 20th century\, made her Paris debut with this legendary performance at the sumptuous Paris Opéra on December 19th\, 1958\, for one night only.  It was a major social event\, attended by “Le Tout Paris” (including French President Coty\, Jean Cocteau\, the Duke & Duchess of Windsor\, Charlie Chaplin\, Brigitte Bardot\, and many more). Callas appeared on the famous stage wearing her most elegant couture and a million dollars’ worth of jewelry. She opened with her signature role\, Norma’s “Casta diva”\, followed by the haunting "Miserere" scene from Verdi's Il Trovatore\, before she lightened the mood with the mischievous “Una voce poco fa” from Il Barbiere di Siviglia. The climax of the evening came in the second half: a fully staged performance of Tosca\, Act II.  Tosca is a story of police brutality\, sexual harassment\, and sheer violence\, psychological and physical\, conveyed through some of opera's most iconic moments – including the great aria “Vissi d’arte”. Callas’ now-legendary interpretation of “Vissi d’arte” was already beloved during her lifetime\, as seen in the audience’s enthusiastic reaction captured in the film\, which caused the production to halt temporarily. Callas - joined by her brilliant sparring partner\, Tito Gobbi\, as Scarpia - savours this material in a monumental virtuoso performance.  The repertoire in this performance shows Callas at her best\, both in recital and as an operatic actress. Visual elements were as important as the vocal dimensions in her art.  Available for the first time entirely in colour and in 4K Ultra HD - meticulously restored from the recently discovered original 16mm reels and a newly discovered sound source – this is an opportunity to experience this historical performance as never before.  Produced by the team behind the award-winning film “Maria by Callas”.

DESCRIPTION:No animal knows us better than crows. Where there are people\, there are crows. There is no revolution that they have not witnessed. Bloodbath or feast\, they have marveled at both countless times as our chroniclers. As our ubiquitous companions\, crows experience the full spectrum of human behavior. They are idolized\, hunted\, and banished. Considered unlucky and reviled as gallow birds\, they are revered as birds of the soul and messengers of the gods.  Crows are the unknown\, critical observers of human civilization. We should listen to them and study their raven chronicles - we would learn a lot about ourselves.

DESCRIPTION:The new film by Mehmet Ada Öztekin shows the years 1881 to 1919 in the life of Mustafa Kemal Atatürk.  Mustafa Kemal Atatürk is born in Thessaloniki at the end of the 19th century. He is badly affected by the attacks suffered by his father at the hands of the mob. His father\, Ali Rıza Bey’s business and health take a turn for the worse. A while later\, he passes.  For Zübeyde Hanım\, her son is the center of the world and nothing must happen to him. The future she envisions for her son is for him to go to the local school and become an imam as per tradition.  This grandeur future Zübeyde Hanım wants for her little son Mustafa\, compared to the huge fire in him\, is like a small hay.  Mustafa Kemal graduates from the academy in 1905 as a Staff Captain. From 1905 to 1919 he serves in various places on Ottoman lands including Syria\, Tripoli\, Thessaloniki and Kars. He realizes that the authority in his country is already in jeopardy and that merit and patriotism no longer exist.  Mustafa Kemal feels he has run out of options. In his own words ‘the country is in flames just like his father’s logs burnt by the mob. He must do something to save it.  As Namık Kemal said\; The enemy had struck its blade into the heart of the nation. But surely\, someone will come forth and save its bleak destiny.
