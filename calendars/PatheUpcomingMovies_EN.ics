DESCRIPTION:On August 30\, 1972\, in New York City\, John Lennon played his only full-length show after leaving The Beatles\, the One to One benefit concert at Madison Square Garden\, a rollicking\, dazzling performance from him and Yoko Ono. Macdonald’s riveting documentary takes that legendary musical event and uses it as the starting point to explore eighteen defining months in the lives of John and Yoko. By 1971 the couple was newly arrived in the United States— living in a tiny apartment in Greenwich Village and watching a huge amount of American television. The film uses a riotous mélange of American TV to conjure the era through what the two would have been seeing on the screen: the Vietnam War\, The Price is Right\, Nixon\, Coca-Cola ads\, Cronkite\, The Waltons. As they experience a year of love and transformation in the US\, John and Yoko begin to change their approach to protest  — ultimately leading to the One to One concert\, which was inspired by a Geraldo Rivera exposé they watched on TV. Filmed in a meticulously faithful reproduction of the NYC apartment the duo shared\, ONE TO ONE: JOHN & YOKO offers a bold new take on a seminal time in the lives of two of history’s most influential artists. <br/>

DESCRIPTION:Two years after M3GAN\, a marvel of artificial intelligence\, went rogue and embarked on a murderous (and impeccably choreographed) rampage and was subsequently destroyed\, M3GAN’s creator Gemma (Allison Williams) has become a high-profile author and advocate for government oversight of A.I. Meanwhile\, Gemma’s niece Cady (Violet McGraw)\, now 14\, has become a teenager\, rebelling against Gemma’s overprotective rules.<br/><br/>Unbeknownst to them\, the underlying tech for M3GAN has been stolen and misused by a powerful defense contractor to create a military-grade weapon known as Amelia (Ivanna Sakhno\; Ahsoka\, Pacific Rim: Uprising)\, the ultimate killer infiltration spy. But as Amelia’s self-awareness increases\, she becomes decidedly less interested in taking orders from humans. Or in keeping them around.<br/><br/>With the future of human existence on the line\, Gemma realizes that the only option is to resurrect M3GAN (Amie Donald\, voiced by Jenna Davis) and give her a few upgrades\, making her faster\, stronger\, and more lethal. As their paths collide\, the original A.I bitch is about to meet her match.
