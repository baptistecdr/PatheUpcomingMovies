When one of the group leaves the island on a mission into the dark heart of the mainland\, he discovers secrets\, wonders\, and horrors that have mutated not only the infected but other survivors as well.

Meanwhile\, Gemma’s niece Cady (Violet McGraw)\, now 14\, has become a teenager\, rebelling against Gemma’s overprotective rules.<br/><br/>Unbeknownst to them\, the underlying tech for M3GAN has been stolen and misused by a powerful defense contractor to create a military-grade weapon known as Amelia (Ivanna Sakhno\; Ahsoka\, Pacific Rim: Uprising)\, the ultimate killer infiltration spy. But as Amelia’s self-awareness increases\, she becomes decidedly less interested in taking orders from humans. Or in keeping them around.<br/><br/>With the future of human existence on the line\, Gemma realizes that the only option is to resurrect M3GAN (Amie Donald\, voiced by Jenna Davis) and give her a few upgrades\, making her faster\, stronger\, and more lethal. As their paths collide\, the original A.I bitch is about to meet her match.
