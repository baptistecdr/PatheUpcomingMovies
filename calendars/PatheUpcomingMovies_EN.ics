DESCRIPTION:It’s the summer of 1957. Ex-racecar driver\, Enzo Ferrari\, is in crisis. All the dramatic forces of his life – as volatile as the red race cars he builds – are in collision. Bankruptcy stalks the company he and his wife\, Laura\, built from nothing ten years earlier. Their tempestuous marriage struggles with the mourning for one son and the acknowledgement of another.  The passionate instigator of men inspires his Spring Team of drivers\, some like surrogate sons. He blunts a hostile press with strafing wit and boldly strategizes to roll the dice on one race – 1\,000 miles across Italy\, the infamous Mille Miglia.  As the red cars slam through towns and mountain passes towards unpredictable outcomes\, the future of these vivid characters’ lives are being written.

DESCRIPTION:Acclaimed English director Carrie Cracknell brings a vital new production of one of opera’s most enduringly powerful works\, reinvigorating the classic story with a staging that moves the action to the modern day and finds at the heart of the drama issues that could not be more relevant today: gendered violence\, abusive labor structures\, and the desire to break through societal boundaries. Dazzling young mezzo-soprano Aigul Akhmetshina leads a powerhouse quartet of stars in the complex and volatile title role\, alongside tenor Piotr Beczała as Carmen’s troubled lover Don José\, soprano Angel Blue as the loyal Micaëla\, and bass-baritone Kyle Ketelsen as the swaggering Escamillo. Daniele Rustioni conducts Bizet’s heart-pounding score.

DESCRIPTION:Paris\, 1887. Duels have been officially outlawed but are still regular practice. For many\, they are the only way to defend their honor. Fencing master Clément Lacaze tries in vain to prevent his nephew from engaging in an uneven duel with the more experienced Colonel Berchère. Marie-Rose Astié de Valsayre\, a feminist fighting for women's equality\, tries to show that honor is not just a male affair. Actor and director Vincent Perez's historical film makes excellent use of various forms of duels - with épées\, pistols\, and sabres on horseback.

DESCRIPTION:Das Chaos hat vier Namen. Livi (Lilit Serger)\, Tessa (Momo Beier)\, Malea (Cara Vondey) und Kenny (Ronja Regjepi). Die Schwestern haben erstmal nichts gemeinsam. Ausser dem Nachnamen Martini. Womit jede von ihnen mehr als fein ist. Denn sind wir mal ehrlich: nicht nur Eltern sind mega peinlich – sondern meist auch die eigenen Geschwister. Und wenn man sich seine Familie schon nicht aussuchen kann\, dann muss man versuchen so wenig wie möglich mit ihnen zu tun zu haben. Doch das wird sich bald ändern. Grund dafür ist Paul. Ein Pinguin. Paul wird aus dem Zoo entführt und landet über Umwege bei den Martinis. Die Chaosschwestern finden heraus\, dass ein Magier-Duo hinter der Entführung steckt. Diese wollen den Pinguin zu einem Teil ihrer Show machen und dadurch ihre ins Stocken geratene Karriere in Las Vegas wieder in Schwung bringen. Den Schwestern wird klar\, dass sie diesen Plan verhindern und den Pinguin zurück zu seiner Familie in den Zoo bringen müssen. Alle für eine – und eine oder keine!

With no family and nowhere to go over Christmas holiday in 1970\, Paul remains at school to supervise students unable to journey home. After a few days\, only one student holdover remains -- a trouble-making 15-year-old named Angus\, a good student whose bad behavior always threatens to get him expelled. Joining Paul and Angus is head cook Mary (Randolph)-an African American woman who caters to sons of privilege and whose own son was recently lost in Vietnam. These three very different shipwrecked people form an unlikely Christmas family sharing comic misadventures during two very snowy weeks in New England. The real journey is how they help one another understand that they are not beholden to their past-they can choose their own futures.

DESCRIPTION:No animal knows us better than crows. Where there are people\, there are crows. There is no revolution that they have not witnessed. Bloodbath or feast\, they have marveled at both countless times as our chroniclers. As our ubiquitous companions\, crows experience the full spectrum of human behavior. They are idolized\, hunted\, and banished. Considered unlucky and reviled as gallow birds\, they are revered as birds of the soul and messengers of the gods.  Crows are the unknown\, critical observers of human civilization. We should listen to them and study their raven chronicles - we would learn a lot about ourselves.
