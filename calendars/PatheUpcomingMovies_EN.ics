DESCRIPTION:ACT I<br/>Isolde\, an Irish princess\, is being taken to Cornwall aboard the ship of Tristan\, whose uncle\, King Marke\, plans to marry her. She becomes enraged by a sailor’s song about an Irish girl\, and her maid\, Brangäne\, tries to calm her. Isolde interrogates Tristan\, but he replies evasively. His companion Kurwenal loudly ridicules the Irish women and sings a mocking verse about Morold\, Isolde’s fiancé\, who was killed by Tristan when he came to Cornwall to exact tribute for Ireland. Isolde\, barely able to control her anger\, tells Brangäne how the wounded Tristan came to her in disguise after his fight with Morold so that he could be healed by Isolde’s knowledge of herbs and magic\, which she learned from her mother. Isolde explains to Brangäne that she recognized Tristan\, but her determination to take revenge for Morold’s death dissolved when he pleadingly looked her in the eyes. She now bitterly regrets her reluctance to kill him and wishes death for him and herself. Brangäne reminds her that to marry a king is no dishonor and that Tristan is simply performing his duty. Isolde maintains that his behavior shows his lack of love for her\, and asks Brangäne to prepare her mother’s death potion. Kurwenal tells the women to prepare to leave the ship\, as shouts from the deck announce the sighting of land. Isolde insists that she will not accompany Tristan until he apologizes for his offenses. He appears and greets her with cool courtesy. When she tells him she wants satisfaction for Morold’s death\, Tristan offers her his sword\, but she will not kill him. Instead\, Isolde suggests that she and Tristan make peace with a drink of friendship. He understands that she means to poison them both\, but still drinks\, and she does the same. Expecting death\, they exchange a long look of love\, then fall into each other’s arms. Brangäne admits that she has in fact mixed a love potion\, as sailors’ voices announce the ship’s arrival in Cornwall.<br/><br/>ACT II<br/>In the garden of Marke’s castle\, Isolde waits impatiently for a rendezvous with Tristan\, while distant horns signal the king’s departure on a hunting party. Isolde believes that the party is far off\, but Brangäne warns her about spies\, particularly Melot\, a jealous knight whom she has noticed watching Tristan. Isolde replies that Melot is Tristan’s friend. She sends Brangäne off to stand watch and puts out the warning torch. When Tristan appears\, she welcomes him passionately. They praise the darkness that shuts out the light of conventionality and false appearances and agree that they feel secure in the night’s embrace. Brangäne’s distant voice warns that it will be daylight soon\, but the lovers are oblivious to any danger and compare the night to death\, which will ultimately unite them. Kurwenal rushes in with a warning: the king and his followers have returned\, led by Melot\, who denounces the lovers. Moved and disturbed\, Marke declares that it was Tristan himself who urged him to marry and choose the bride. He does not understand how someone so dear to him could dishonor him in such a way. Tristan cannot answer. He asks Isolde if she will follow him into the realm of death. When she accepts\, Melot attacks Tristan\, who falls wounded into Kurwenal’s arms.<br/><br/>ACT III<br/>Back at his castle\, the mortally ill Tristan is tended by Kurwenal. A shepherd inquires about his master\, and Kurwenal explains that only Isolde\, with her magic arts\, could save him. The shepherd agrees to play a cheerful tune on his pipe as soon as he sees a ship approaching. Hallucinating\, Tristan imagines the realm of night where he will return with Isolde. He thanks Kurwenal for his devotion\, then envisions Isolde’s ship approaching\, but the shepherd’s mournful tune signals that the sea is still empty. Tristan recalls the melody\, which he heard as a child. It reminds him of the duel with Morold\, and he wishes Isolde’s medicine had killed him then instead of making him suffer now. The shepherd’s tune finally turns cheerful. Tristan gets up from his sickbed in growing agitation and tears off his bandages\, letting his wounds bleed. Isolde rushes in\, and he falls\, dying\, in her arms. When the shepherd announces the arrival of another ship\, Kurwenal assumes it carries Marke and Melot\, and barricades the gate. Brangäne’s voice is heard from outside\, trying to calm Kurwenal\, but he will not listen and stabs Melot before he is killed himself by the king’s soldiers. Marke is overwhelmed with grief at the sight of the dead Tristan\, while Brangäne explains to Isolde that the king has come to pardon the lovers. Isolde\, transfigured\, does not hear her\, and with a vision of Tristan beckoning her to the world beyond\, she sinks dying upon his body.

DESCRIPTION:Last year’s global cinematic cultural sensation\, which became the most successful Broadway film adaptation of all time\, now reaches its epic\, electrifying\, emotional conclusion in Wicked: For Good. <br/><br/>Directed once again by award-winning director Jon M. Chu and starring the spectacular returning cast\, led by Academy Award® nominated superstars Cynthia Erivo and Ariana Grande\, the final chapter of the untold story of the witches of Oz begins with Elphaba and Glinda estranged and living with the consequences of their choices. <br/><br/>Elphaba (Cynthia Erivo)\, now demonized as The Wicked Witch of the West\, lives in exile\, hidden within the Ozian forest while continuing her fight for the freedom of Oz’s silenced Animals and desperately trying to expose the truth she knows about The Wizard (Jeff Goldblum). <br/><br/>Glinda\, meanwhile\, has become the glamorous symbol of Goodness for all of Oz\, living at the palace in Emerald City and reveling in the perks of fame and popularity. Under the instruction of Madame Morrible (Oscar® winner Michelle Yeoh)\, Glinda is deployed to serve as an effervescent comfort to Oz\, reassuring the masses that all is well under the rule of The Wizard. <br/><br/>As Glinda’s stardom expands and she prepares to marry Prince Fiyero (Olivier award winner and Emmy and SAG nominee Jonathan Bailey) in a spectacular Ozian wedding\, she is haunted by her separation from Elphaba. She attempts to broker a conciliation between Elphaba and The Wizard\, but those efforts will fail\, driving Elphaba and Glinda only further apart. The aftershocks will transform Boq (Tony nominee Ethan Slater) and Fiyero forever\, and threaten the safety of Elphaba’s sister\, Nessarose (Marissa Bode)\, when a girl from Kansas comes crashing into all their lives. <br/><br/>As an angry mob rises against the Wicked Witch\, Glinda and Elphaba will need to come together one final time. With their singular friendship now the fulcrum of their futures\, they will need to truly see each other\, with honesty and empathy\, if they are to change themselves\, and all of Oz\, for good. <br/><br/>Wicked: For Good also stars Emmy nominee Bowen Yang and Bronwyn James as Glinda’s fawning assistants\, Pfannee and ShenShen and BAFTA and Grammy nominee Sharon D. Clarke (Caroline\, or Change) as the voice of Elphaba’s childhood nanny\, Dulcibear. <br/><br/>The film is produced by returning Tony and Emmy winning powerhouse Marc Platt p.g.a. and by multiple Tony winner David Stone. The executive producers are Stephen Schwartz\, David Nicksay\, Jared LeBoff\, Winnie Holzman and Dana Fox. The first film\, Wicked\, released in November 2024\, earned 10 Academy Award® nominations\, including Best Picture\, and won the Oscars® for Costume Design and Production Design. To date\, the film has grossed $750 million worldwide. <br/><br/><br/>Wicked: For Good is based on the generation-defining musical stage play with music and lyrics by legendary Grammy and Oscar® winning composer and lyricist Stephen Schwartz and book by Winnie Holzman\, from the bestselling novel by Gregory Maguire. The screenplay is by Winnie Holzman and Winnie Holzman & Dana Fox. The film score is by John Powell & Stephen Schwartz\, with music and lyrics by Stephen Schwartz. <br/>

DESCRIPTION:American composer Gabriela Lena Frank makes her Met debut with her first opera\, a magical-realist portrait of Mexico’s painterly power couple Frida Kahlo and Diego Rivera\, with libretto by Pulitzer Prize–winning playwright Nilo Cruz. Fashioned as a reversal of the Orpheus and Euridice myth\, the story depicts Frida\, sung by leading mezzo-soprano Isabel Leonard\, leaving the underworld on the Day of the Dead and reuniting with Diego\, portrayed by baritone Carlos Álvarez. The famously feuding pair briefly relive their tumultuous love\, embracing both the passion and the pain before bidding the land of the living a final farewell. Yannick Nézet-Séguin conducts the Met premiere of Frank’s opera\, a “confident\, richly imagined score” (The New Yorker) that “bursts with color and fresh individuality” (Los Angeles Times). The vibrant new production\, taking enthusiastic inspiration from Frida and Diego’s paintings\, is directed and choreographed by Deborah Colker\, following her remarkable 2024 debut staging of Ainadamar.

DESCRIPTION:A beautifully realized tale of civilization versus nature\, PRINCESS MONONOKE is a true epic by Japan’s master animator Hayao Miyazaki.<br/><br/>While protecting his village from a rampaging boar-god\, the young warrior Ashitaka becomes afflicted with a deadly curse. To find the cure that will save his life\, he journeys deep into the sacred depths of the Great Forest Spirit’s realm where he meets San (Princess Mononoke)\, a girl raised by wolves. It’s not long before Ashitaka is caught in the middle of a battle between iron-ore prospecting humans and the forest dwellers. He must summon the spirit-powers and all his courage to stop man and nature from destroying<br/>each other.<br/><br/>One of Miyazaki’s most dark and mature films and certainly violent\, PRINCESS MONONOKE is a fantasy epic with a dire environmental message.
