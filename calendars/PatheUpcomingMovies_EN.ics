DESCRIPTION:From Will Packer\, the blockbuster producer of Girls Trip\, the Ride Along franchise\, and ten movies that have opened No. 1 at the U.S. box office—including Night School\, This Christmas and Think Like a Man—comes a delicious romantic comedy about one little lie\, one large Italian villa\, and two people getting lost in the sauce of love. <br/><br/>Halle Bailey (The Little Mermaid\, The Color Purple) stars as Anna\, a young woman who has abandoned her dreams of becoming a chef and is now drifting through her twenties with a series of bad choices. When Anna loses her house-sitting job (and housing) in one fell swoop\, a chance encounter with Matteo—a handsome Italian who happens to have a villa sitting empty in Tuscany—will inspire her to jet off for Italy\, against the advice of her always-honest bestie\, Claire (Home Before Dark’s Aziza Scott).  <br/><br/>But Anna’s plan to crash at Matteo’s villa\, without permission\, just for one night\, falls apart when Matteo’s mother\, Gabriella (Italian film icon Isabella Ferrari) shows up at the house unexpectedly. In a panic\, Anna allows Gabriella to believe that she is Matteo’s fiancée. <br/><br/>That little lie becomes a big problem\, though\, when Matteo’s cousin\, Michael (Regé-Jean Page\; Bridgerton\, Black Bag) shows up\, and Anna discovers that the heat between them may ignite a fire that will transform her life. <br/><br/>The film’s international cast includes Lorenzo de Moor (The Legend Hunters) as Matteo\, Marco Calvani (The Four Seasons) as an Italian taxi driver who befriends Anna and Academy Award® nominee Nia Vardalos (My Big Fat Greek Wedding) as Anna’s house-sitting client\, Mrs. Dunn.  <br/><br/>You\, Me & Tuscany is directed by acclaimed filmmaker Kat Coiro (Marry Me\, Matlock)\, from a screenplay by Ryan Engle (Rampage\, Beast)\, based on an original idea by Ryan Engle and Kristin Engle. The film is produced by Will Packer (Girls Trip\, Ride Along films) and Johanna Byer (Point Blank\, executive producer Praise This) for Will Packer Productions. The executive producers are Ryan Engle and Kristin Engle.

His companion Kurwenal loudly ridicules the Irish women and sings a mocking verse about Morold\, Isolde’s fiancé\, who was killed by Tristan when he came to Cornwall to exact tribute for Ireland. Isolde\, barely able to control her anger\, tells Brangäne how the wounded Tristan came to her in disguise after his fight with Morold so that he could be healed by Isolde’s knowledge of herbs and magic\, which she learned from her mother. Isolde explains to Brangäne that she recognized Tristan\, but her determination to take revenge for Morold’s death dissolved when he pleadingly looked her in the eyes. She now bitterly regrets her reluctance to kill him and wishes death for him and herself. Brangäne reminds her that to marry a king is no dishonor and that Tristan is simply performing his duty. Isolde maintains that his behavior shows his lack of love for her\, and asks Brangäne to prepare her mother’s death potion. Kurwenal tells the women to prepare to leave the ship\, as shouts from the deck announce the sighting of land. Isolde insists that she will not accompany Tristan until he apologizes for his offenses. He appears and greets her with cool courtesy. When she tells him she wants satisfaction for Morold’s death\, Tristan offers her his sword\, but she will not kill him. Instead\, Isolde suggests that she and Tristan make peace with a drink of friendship. He understands that she means to poison them both\, but still drinks\, and she does the same. Expecting death\, they exchange a long look of love\, then fall into each other’s arms. Brangäne admits that she has in fact mixed a love potion\, as sailors’ voices announce the ship’s arrival in Cornwall.<br/><br/>ACT II<br/>In the garden of Marke’s castle\, Isolde waits impatiently for a rendezvous with Tristan\, while distant horns signal the king’s departure on a hunting party. Isolde believes that the party is far off\, but Brangäne warns her about spies\, particularly Melot\, a jealous knight whom she has noticed watching Tristan. Isolde replies that Melot is Tristan’s friend. She sends Brangäne off to stand watch and puts out the warning torch. When Tristan appears\, she welcomes him passionately. They praise the darkness that shuts out the light of conventionality and false appearances and agree that they feel secure in the night’s embrace. Brangäne’s distant voice warns that it will be daylight soon\, but the lovers are oblivious to any danger and compare the night to death\, which will ultimately unite them. Kurwenal rushes in with a warning: the king and his followers have returned\, led by Melot\, who denounces the lovers. Moved and disturbed\, Marke declares that it was Tristan himself who urged him to marry and choose the bride. He does not understand how someone so dear to him could dishonor him in such a way. Tristan cannot answer. He asks Isolde if she will follow him into the realm of death. When she accepts\, Melot attacks Tristan\, who falls wounded into Kurwenal’s arms.<br/><br/>ACT III<br/>Back at his castle\, the mortally ill Tristan is tended by Kurwenal. A shepherd inquires about his master\, and Kurwenal explains that only Isolde\, with her magic arts\, could save him. The shepherd agrees to play a cheerful tune on his pipe as soon as he sees a ship approaching. Hallucinating\, Tristan imagines the realm of night where he will return with Isolde. He thanks Kurwenal for his devotion\, then envisions Isolde’s ship approaching\, but the shepherd’s mournful tune signals that the sea is still empty. Tristan recalls the melody\, which he heard as a child. It reminds him of the duel with Morold\, and he wishes Isolde’s medicine had killed him then instead of making him suffer now. The shepherd’s tune finally turns cheerful. Tristan gets up from his sickbed in growing agitation and tears off his bandages\, letting his wounds bleed. Isolde rushes in\, and he falls\, dying\, in her arms. When the shepherd announces the arrival of another ship\, Kurwenal assumes it carries Marke and Melot\, and barricades the gate. Brangäne’s voice is heard from outside\, trying to calm Kurwenal\, but he will not listen and stabs Melot before he is killed himself by the king’s soldiers. Marke is overwhelmed with grief at the sight of the dead Tristan\, while Brangäne explains to Isolde that the king has come to pardon the lovers. Isolde\, transfigured\, does not hear her\, and with a vision of Tristan beckoning her to the world beyond\, she sinks dying upon his body.

DESCRIPTION:A beautifully realized tale of civilization versus nature\, PRINCESS MONONOKE is a true epic by Japan’s master animator Hayao Miyazaki.<br/><br/>While protecting his village from a rampaging boar-god\, the young warrior Ashitaka becomes afflicted with a deadly curse. To find the cure that will save his life\, he journeys deep into the sacred depths of the Great Forest Spirit’s realm where he meets San (Princess Mononoke)\, a girl raised by wolves. It’s not long before Ashitaka is caught in the middle of a battle between iron-ore prospecting humans and the forest dwellers. He must summon the spirit-powers and all his courage to stop man and nature from destroying<br/>each other.<br/><br/>One of Miyazaki’s most dark and mature films and certainly violent\, PRINCESS MONONOKE is a fantasy epic with a dire environmental message. The end result is almost Kurosawa-Esque in story and structure. Whilst initial box-office was poor in the West\, eventually became Studio Ghibli’s breakthrough film off the back of home video sales.

DESCRIPTION:American composer Gabriela Lena Frank makes her Met debut with her first opera\, a magical-realist portrait of Mexico’s painterly power couple Frida Kahlo and Diego Rivera\, with libretto by Pulitzer Prize–winning playwright Nilo Cruz. Fashioned as a reversal of the Orpheus and Euridice myth\, the story depicts Frida\, sung by leading mezzo-soprano Isabel Leonard\, leaving the underworld on the Day of the Dead and reuniting with Diego\, portrayed by baritone Carlos Álvarez. The famously feuding pair briefly relive their tumultuous love\, embracing both the passion and the pain before bidding the land of the living a final farewell. Yannick Nézet-Séguin conducts the Met premiere of Frank’s opera\, a “confident\, richly imagined score” (The New Yorker) that “bursts with color and fresh individuality” (Los Angeles Times). The vibrant new production\, taking enthusiastic inspiration from Frida and Diego’s paintings\, is directed and choreographed by Deborah Colker\, following her remarkable 2024 debut staging of Ainadamar.

Doch gerade als Justus Jonas (JULIUS WECKAUF)\, Peter Shaw (NEVIO WENDT) und Bob Andrews (LEVI BRANDL) aufbrechen wollen\, klingelt in der Zentrale das Telefon und ein unbekannter Anrufer übergibt dem Detektiv-Trio ihren neuesten Fall.

Denn die dort gelegene Ruhestätte eines uralten Volkes soll mit einem Fluch belegt sein: Niemand\, der Makatao betritt\, kommt lebend zurück. Warum begibt sich Sphinx auf eine so waghalsige Reise?
