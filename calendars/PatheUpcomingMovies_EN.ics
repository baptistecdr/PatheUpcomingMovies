DESCRIPTION:Music Director Yannick Nézet-Séguin conducts his first Met performances of Strauss’s white-hot one-act tragedy\, which receives its first new production at the company in 20 years. Claus Guth\, one of Europe’s leading opera directors\, gives the biblical story—already filtered through the beautiful and strange imagination of Oscar Wilde’s play—a psychologically perceptive\, Victorian-era setting rich in symbolism and subtle shades of darkness and light. Headlining the new staging is soprano Elza van den Heever as the abused and unhinged antiheroine\, who demands the head of Jochanaan\, sung by celebrated baritone Peter Mattei. Tenor Gerhard Siegel is Salome’s lecherous stepfather\, King Herod\, with mezzo-soprano Michelle DeYoung as his wife\, Herodias\, and tenor Piotr Buszewski as Narraboth. This live cinema transmission is part of the Met’s award-winning Live in HD series\, bringing opera to movie theaters across the globe.
